# Library-Management-System
The library management system website designed by our group is a comprehensive tool for managing the resources and operations of a library. Built using a combination of PHP, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and XAMPP, this website provides a user-friendly interface for library staff and patrons to access and manage library resources.
